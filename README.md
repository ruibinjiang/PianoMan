# PianoMan
Purdue Univsersity ECE Senior Design Project F2020

PianoMan is a digital keyboard for beginners that removes the learning curve of music theory from the process of learning how to play a song. The keyboard features three modes to give users multiple ways to learn. Notes will be translated from a MIDI file to LEDs associated with the keys to tell the user what notes to play. The user will be able to load a desired song onto an SD card to play whatever they desire.
